Programming for Spatial Analysts: Core Skills

Step 1. Open Spyder (Anaconda 3). If you have not got this downloaded, it can be installed through the Anaconda Distribution here. https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ . My Model code works with Python 3.7. Ensure when going through the installation process that you download ‘Spyder’. 

Step 2. Select this Repository (https://github.com/gy19cp/gy19cp.github.io) hyperlink, which should take you directly to the model repository within the Github website. This contains all files for the model.

Step 3. Select the green ‘clone or download’ button and download ‘Zip’. 

Step 4. Once downloaded, select the folder, extract all into a suitable file and open Spyder.

Step 5. Within Spyder, click on ‘File’ and ‘Open’, ensuring you locate to where you previously extracted the file. Hold the shift key and choose ‘agentframework’ and ‘model’ to ‘open’. 

Step 6. Have the ‘agentframework’ file selected within Spyder and click the green right-pointed arrow to ‘Run’ it.

Step 7. Now the model will be run. Select the ‘model’ file within Spyder and click ‘Run’ again. This time a box entitled ‘Model’ should pop out. Click the subheading ‘Menu’ and ‘Run Model’. 

When the model is run, the orange dots represent ‘Foxes’ and the white dots represent ‘Sheep’. Where there are squares of differing darkness and no sheep around it is likely a ‘fox’ has ‘eaten’ a ‘sheep’. This model will run until a specific number of steps (‘num_of_iterations’) has been completed.
