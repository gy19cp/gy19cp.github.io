Claire is a current MSc Geographical Information Systems (GIS) student at the University of Leeds (2019-2020). She was previously awarded a first class BSc Geography degree from Bangor University, North Wales. Her dissertation focussed on "Potentially Harmful Elements due to Metal Mining contamination in Cononley Beck, a tributary of the River Aire, North Yorkshire", which can be made available upon request. She completed this alongside six modules including an advanced GIS and Remote Sensing course, where 92% was awarded upon course completion. This course covered the use of ArcGIS and extensions: Model Builder and Network Analyst alongside ArcGlobe and ArcScene. 

During the course of the MSc GIS, Claire has been part of a module "Programming for Geographical Information Analysts: Core Skills". This course has developed her computer programming practical skills, particuarly with the use of Spyder (Anaconda 3) to create an agent-based model, which involves writing and structuring code, getting different code to interact and gettings code to interact with users. This  model inparticular is animated and interacts with an agent code and an environment to produce coordinates on a 'raster' grid. These plotted points (coordinates) are produced randomly and subsequently 'eat' some of the environment and 'talk' to the neigbouring points. The code uses core Python language with an object oriented approach, continous integration and web-scraping.

The model code can be found below.
