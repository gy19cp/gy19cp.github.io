	<p>This Portfolio was created during an MSc Geographical Information Systems (GIS) at the University of Leeds and following course completion
		is now updated to showcase selected pieces of work I complete in my spare time.</p>
	
	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>Having recently finished my <b>MSc GIS</b> course (2019-2020), I look forward to further developing my skills in the Geospatial sector.
		I am <b>open to part-time paid and voluntary remote</b> opportunities. Below are a selection of skills developed and 
		<b>achievements</b> throughout higher education courses.</p> 
		<br>
	<p>Masters-level modules completed include <b>Data Visualisation</b> and Analysis, <b>Geodemographics</b> and Neighbourhood Analysis,  
		<b>Web-based</b> GIS and Digital Image Processing for Environmental <b>Remote Sensing</b>. A Personal and 
		Professional Development project involved "Identification of Informal Settlements across the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina using ENVI Rule-Based 
		Classification". This course covered the use of software including ArcMap, ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, SPSS, Tableau, and Erdas Imagine.</p> 
		<br>
	<p>I was previously awarded a <b>first class</b> BSc Geography degree. My dissertation focussed on 
   	"Potentially Harmful Elements due to Metal Mining contamination in Cononley Beck, a tributary of the River Aire, North Yorkshire". All work can be made 
	available upon request. I completed this alongside six modules including an advanced GIS and Remote Sensing 
   	course, where 92% was awarded upon course completion. This course covered the use of ArcMap and extensions: Spatial Analyst, Model Builder and 
   	Network Analyst alongside ArcGlobe and ArcScene.</p> 
  	
	<h2>Recent Achievements</h2>
	<ol>
	<li>My 15,000 word Masters Dissertation entitled "Digital Divide: Mapping the Geodemographics of Internet Accessibility across Great Britain" was awarded 
		<a href="https://thesla.org/awards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2nd place</a> in a <b>national competition</b> run by the Society of Location Analysis.
	<br>
	<li>Awarded a <b>Distinction</b> in my MSc GIS course.
